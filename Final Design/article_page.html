          Shipments of Chinese Port side inventories of imported Iron ore continued this week, 
          with the average daily shipments from port reaching 3.06 million tons, as mills in the 
          North picked up pace, aggressively restocking inventories on account of the upcoming Labor Day holiday over May 1st -5th ,2020. 
          Moreover, BHP and Rio Tinto at the recent announcement of production results, pointed out that while demand has fallen across 
          the board, demand for high quality iron ore in China remained robust, with prices driven further up by seaborne disruptions amid COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Eastern Chinese Mills reported plentiful inventories at plants and port, hence buying activity in the region remained muted.
          Imported iron ore port stock prices remained volatile this week, declining for most part of the week, Spot prices of 62% Fe fines, 
          FOT Qingdao were assessed at RMB680/t on Monday, however prices in the imported iron ore portside market declined over the week, settling at RMB670/t, 
          down by RMB10/t or nearly 1.5% over the weeks trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decline in prices of portside inventories could be attributed to steelmakers increasing their usage of domestic iron ore as margins for rebar have reportedly thinned in recent days. 
          Market participants have reported, Chinese steelmakers gradually substituting imported fines with more domestic iron ore concentrates in their blast furnaces amid robust iron ore port prices, 
          with the daily usage and stocks of domestic sintering concentrates at mills increasing during April.

          Much like physical markets, iron ore futures contracts at the DCE experienced a volatile week, with the most actively traded September Iron Ore futures contract at the DCE i2009 opened at RMB620/t on Monday, 
          however, futures declined by RMB13/t or nearly 2.1% during the week, closing at RMB607/t on Friday, April 24th, 2020. Iron Ore Futures however, proved resilient as compared to other commodities despite the US 
          oil market crash this week, with WTI’s May futures contract finishing out Monday’s session at negative $37.63 a barrel; as oil demand remains at historical lows as a result of COVID-19 and with US crude storage capacity quickly filling up.
